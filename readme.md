# Problem Domain

**Outfit Manager**
- add, remove, modify items of clothing a person has
- help select an outfit based on parameters
- use fashion guidelines / colour theory to select clothing
- use weather API to determine weather conditions

# Description

We have an idea of an app that would tell users what to wear on a given day based on the weather, users' plans,
and perhaps some other conditions.

It is based on the idea of eliminating decision fatigue - saving time on making everyday choices.

We can add many interesting features to it, like adding pictures of clothing items a user has, accessing location,
using weather API, perhaps even incorporating some fashion / colour theory to form interesting outfit combinations.
In the future we could add promotional integrations with some brands by recommending their clothing more.

# Weather API
The API we're using is [OpenMeteo](https://open-meteo.com/).
